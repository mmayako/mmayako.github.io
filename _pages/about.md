I am an ECE PhD Student at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I am studying quantum optics and quantum communication. I'm advised by [Prof. Yanne K. Chembo](https://ece.umd.edu/clark/faculty/1031/Yanne-Chembo) and I am supported by the [Clark Doctoral Fellowship](https://eng.umd.edu/clark-doctoral-fellows).

I graduated with B.S. degrees in [physics](https://web.physics.udel.edu/) and [applied mathematics](https://www.mathsci.udel.edu/) from the [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/) in 2022. As an undergrad, I conducted research on opto-electronic and quantum materials with [Dr. Zubaer Hossain](https://sites.google.com/view/zubaer-tamu) and [Dr. Mark Ku](https://mseg.udel.edu/people/mark-ku/). I also had a short but very enjoyable stint on a computational oncology project studying colorectal cancer with [Dr. Gilberto Schleiniger](https://sites.udel.edu/schleini/research-interests/) and [Dr. Bruce Boman](https://christianacare.org/people/bruce-m-boman-md/).

If you are interested in applying to a PhD program and would like to hear about my application process, feel free to ask me about it! I am happy to do my part to make academia more diverse and equitable. If youâ€™d like to learn about me, [check out this page](https://mmayako.github.io/fun/). 

Feel free to get in touch if anything here piques your interest!
